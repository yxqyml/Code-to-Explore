Have you ever encountered any concept that seemed straightforward at first glance but left you puzzled as you dug deeper? Code-to-explore is here to address such instances. We believe that the best way to learn is by exploring the 
hidden intricacies, and this repository is dedicated to just that.

We use Python to craft code examples that illustrate these concepts and then take it a step further by creating animations that provide a visual representation of what's happening under the hood. This combination of code and animation 
is designed to make complex ideas more approachable and engaging.

HAPPY CODING!
